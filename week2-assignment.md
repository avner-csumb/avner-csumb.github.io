There are different scales to measure temperature.
 there exist many scales for measuring temperature. Obviously, in the U.S. we use Fahrenheit, but much of the world uses Celsius. You might have heard of Kelvin in high school Chemistry class.

According to Wikipedia, the following scales also exist:

* Rankine
* Delisle
* Newton
* Réaumur
* Rømer
* Wedgwood

We would like to create a temperature converter that takes as input a temperature in Fahrenheit and converts it to all of the other scales.
