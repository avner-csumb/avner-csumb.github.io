## Java Development Kit

:dolls:

When developers say Java, they usually mean the Java Development Kit (JDK), the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Think of it is a Matryoshka doll: the JVM is inside the JRE which comes in the JDK.

## Tasks

Here are your tasks for Week 1:

1. Get the JDK from the following [link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (if you do not already have it).
2. Create a "Hello World" application and run it from the command line.
3. Next, you will want to get an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Java. [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/home/index.php) is a good (free) choice. Another good choice is [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), which is free for students. (**Fun fact:** The IntelliJ Community Edition is free and forms the basis for Android Studio.)
4. Complete Codecademy's [Learn Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) course.
5. Read about [Java interfaces](interfaces).
6. Read about [abstract classes](abstract-classes) in Java.
7. Read about [exceptions](exceptions).
8. When you have finished the above, complete the provided Google Form. (Link will be available on Slack.)

We will use Slack to discuss the above tasks during the week and will then have a wrap-up on Google Hangouts.
