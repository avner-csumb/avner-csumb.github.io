  <h1>Welcome!</h1>

  <p>:sunny:</p>

  <p>
    We are going to learn about several data structures, in addition to discussing runtime complexity (<i>Big O</i>) and problem-solving. We will be holding this bootcamp online. You will be provided with a number of resources and coding exercises. We will have a Slack chat and weekly Google Hangouts. (If you are not familiar with Slack, watch <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218074407-Sending-messages" target=_blank>this video</a> for the basics of sending messages.)
  </p>


  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

  <p>Any code samples will use the Java programming language. To get the most out of this bootcamp, you will want to have a working knowledge of Java.</p>

  <h2>Evaluation</h2>

  <p>No college credit is offered for this bootcamp. It is offered to deepen your understanding and prepare you for internships and jobs. I will ask that you submit completion checklists, but these are on an <b>honor code</b> basis. You will not be submitting assignments and/or taking tests. For this bootcamp, your motivation will be learning and not grades or points.</p>

  <h2>Data Structures</h2>

  <p>Tenatively, we will ocver the following data structures:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Linked Lists (including doubly-linked)</li>
    <li>Trees</li>
    <li>Stacks</li>
    <li>Queues</li>
    <li>Heaps</li>
    <li>Hash Tables</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Java comes with many built-in data structures. For the purpose of this bootcamp, we will not use these, but rather will be building our own.</p>
